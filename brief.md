# Project Objective

ðŸ“Œ Drive as many US app downloads/signups for Tea as possible

By driving high-converting traffic to the app through highly engaging content based on viral concepts

# What makes Tea different from other apps?

- Tea requires selfie gender verification to get into the app so men don't join.
- All posting/commenting on Tea is anonymous to protect women's identities.
- Tea blocks screenshots so info can't be leaked from the app.

# Content Guidelines

1. All content must be original and not reposted/ clipped from other people or past posts. You should still take inspiration from similar successful posts

2. NO mention on rating systems (example: he has 16 red flags)  

3. All edited within TikTok to get native look.

4. Keep your focus on replicating video formats that already worked.Taking Competitor Videos that have gone VIRAL and then making slight changes isa GREAT strategy. Try to make at least half (if not more) of your videos, recreations of competitor videos.

5. For every video that you are making,assume that your viewer has never heard about the App before
